        My husband and I first got married in 1991 in Shanghai. At that time, my husband did not manage to divorce his first wife successfully but we still went ahead to move to Singapore. However, he was charged for bigamy. The charge was eventually dropped and my husband finally managed to divorce his first wife. We finally got married in September 1992 in Singapore, we had it solemnized and registered and everything. Unfortunately, things did not go so well between us and the marriage between us broke down. I returned to Shanghai in 2002. In 2004, my now ex-husband tried to commence some divorce proceedings for our marriage so that he wouldn’t have to give me half of the money we earned together as husband and wife. But clearly my husband is at fault! He was the one who lied to me! He was still married to his first wife when he married me but he said he didn’t know anything. Anyway, our money was left in Singapore totally untouched. Recently, my husband passed away. Under his will, the bulk of his money was left to his children from his first wife. But obviously, at least a portion of the money he claims is his is actually mine. I want to make an appeal to make sure I get back that money from my husband. Our marriage hasn’t been dissolved yet after all.
